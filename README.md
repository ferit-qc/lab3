# Lab3. - Implementation of Quantum Fourier Transformation, Phase Estimation and Shor's Algorithm
 
In this lab, you will explore the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), one of the most important subroutines in quantum computing. You will:

* Learn how to build the QFT circuit both manually and recursively.
* Understand how QFT transforms quantum states into the frequency domain.
* Use Hadamard and controlled phase gates to implement the QFT structure.
* Visualize how the QFT circuit scales with the number of qubits using interactive tools.
* Apply QFT in Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) — a key component of powerful algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm.

By the end of the lab, you’ll gain both conceptual insights and hands-on experience with QFT and its applications in real quantum algorithms.
